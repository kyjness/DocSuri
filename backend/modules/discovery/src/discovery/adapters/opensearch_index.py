"""OpenSearch read adapters — real ``VectorStoreAdapter`` + ``LexicalIndexAdapter``.

The reader mirror of U1's ``OpenSearchVectorIndex`` writer: the SAME index
(``docsuri-corpus-v1``), one store serving both k-NN (cosine, ``vector``) and BM25
(``title``/``abstract``/``lexicalTerms``) — hybrid retrieval (FR-2). Hits are
deserialized straight back into the shared ``IndexRecord`` (SSOT round-trip; no forked
shape). OpenSearch is one store, so ANY
query failure raises ``IndexUnavailable`` → the orchestrator fail-closes (INV-3/SEC-15);
there is no index fallback (only embedding has a fallback).

ports declares ``VectorStoreAdapter`` and ``LexicalIndexAdapter`` as two protocols; they are
exposed as two adapter objects but share one OpenSearch client via ``OpenSearchClientFactory``.

# Bounded transient-retry for the single OpenSearch store. Search is a read (idempotent), and
# under heavy concurrent indexing (e.g. a corpus rebuild) the cluster returns brief transient
# failures — a shard relocating, a GC pause, a momentary timeout. A short retry absorbs most of
# those so one unlucky moment does not surface to the user as a 503; repeated failure still
# fail-closes (INV-3). Kept small so an added retry never blows the P50<3s search budget.
#
# Two guards keep the retry inside that budget on the slow/outage path the client's 10s connect-
# and-read ``timeout`` would otherwise stretch across three attempts (~30s):
#   1. Only *known-transient* failures are retried (see ``_is_transient``). A non-transient error
#      — a 4xx query error, an unexpected response shape — fail-closes on the first attempt rather
#      than burning three attempts on something a retry can't fix.
#   2. Retried searches carry a per-request timeout well below the client default, so even a
#      genuine ConnectionTimeout fails its attempt fast; worst-case fail-close is bounded to
#      ~MAX_ATTEMPTS * this + backoff instead of ~30s.

# "first search fails, works on retry" — worst during a corpus reindex, but it recurs after any
# merge / memory eviction / idle period, so it isn't only a backfill artifact). 5.0s absorbs a
